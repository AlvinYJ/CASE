# Incident Report

### Summary

SHECA received a reminder in another case ([1902592 - SHECA: EV certificate subject RDN order is incorrect](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1902592)) that at least one SHECA certificate had an empty cpsURI. We immediately began an investigation and discovered that due to a certificate template issue, six problematic certificates were issued.

The CP item format of the erroneous certificates is as follows. It can be seen that the policyIdentifier of the second PolicyInformation is the EV OID specified by BR, but the cpsURI is empty.

```
[1]Certificate Policy:
     Policy Identifier=1.2.156.112570.1.1.3
     [1,1]Policy Qualifier Info:
          Policy Qualifier Id=CPS
          Qualifier:
               https://www.sheca.com/repository
[2]Certificate Policy:
     Policy Identifier=2.23.140.1.1
     [2,1]Policy Qualifier Info:
          Policy Qualifier Id=CPS
          Qualifier
```

### **Impact**

SHECA issued six certificates that contained an empty cpsURI attribute in the CP item, resulting in an abnormal certificate format. SHECA's investigation found that all six certificates had the same issue. All six erroneous certificates have been revoked or have expired, and since these certificates were for SHECA's internal use, the impact was minimal.

### **Timeline**

All timestamps are in Beijing Time (UTC+8)

- **2023-06-14 21:00** SHECA learned from another case ([crt.sh | 12421770586](https://crt.sh/?id=12421770586)) that the cpsURI was empty.
- **2023-06-15 10:00** Investigation began.
- **2023-06-15 11:07** The compliance department sent an email to the certification department to stop issuing certificates.
- **2023-06-15 10:05** Using the latest version of zlint to check all unexpired certificates, no errors were found.
- **2023-08-15 13:00** Discovered that the reporter used pkilint to find the error, immediately wrote a script to use pkilint to scan all certificates locally.
- **2023-09-17 10:12** Completed the script and began scanning all unexpired certificates.
- **2024-06-17 13:50** Scanned and found six problematic certificates, including [crt.sh/?id=12421770586](https://crt.sh/?id=12421770586) and [crt.sh/?id=12421770586](https://crt.sh/?id=12421770586), which were not revoked.
- **2024-06-17 13:55** Immediately revoked the two certificates.
- **2024-06-17 14:10** Confirmed the issue was due to a certificate template configuration error. In SHECA's EV certificates, two PolicyInformation items are included: the first with a policyIdentifier declared in CPS, cpsURI being SHECA's cps address, and the second containing only the policyIdentifier value specified by the EV OID in BR. During the template modification on November 9, 2023, the second PolicyInformation's cpsURI attribute was checked but not filled in, and the program did not handle this situation, leading to an empty cpsURI value.
- **2024-06-17 14:15** Checked all certificate templates and adjusted any problematic ones.
- **2024-06-17 14:15** Confirmed only the EV certificate template had issues, adjusted the template and resumed issuing other types of SSL certificates except EV SSL certificates.
- **2024-06-18 21:15** Fixed the issuing program to prevent issuing a certificate if the id-qt-cps attribute in the CP item is empty, and checked for similar issues in other extension items.
- **2024-06-18 15:00** Began drafting the incident report.
- **2024-06-19 09:00** Sent the draft report to relevant personnel for review.
- **2024-06-22 20:45** Released the complete incident report.

### **Root Cause Analysis**

Background: In our CA system, all certificate extension items are configurable and can be adjusted through our CA system's interface.

- **Why were certificates with an empty cpsURI issued?**

SHECA's EV certificate template includes two PolicyInformation items: the first has a policyIdentifier declared in CPS, and the cpsURI is the CPS address; the second has a policyIdentifier specified by BR for the EV OID. On November 9, 2023, during a template adjustment, the cpsURI attribute for the second PolicyInformation was checked but not filled in. The program did not warn about this, resulting in an empty cpsURI value.

- **Why was this issue not discovered earlier?**

We use zlint as a detection tool and update it regularly. However, zlint did not support checking for this error because it is not explicitly specified in BR. We have reported this issue to zlint.

- **Why did the certificate template adjustment error occur?**

The certificate template interface design is complex, leading to potential mis-selections during adjustments. Moreover, there was no secondary confirmation process after template adjustments.

### **Lessons Learned**

#### What went well

- SHECA responded quickly upon receiving the alert.

#### What didn't go well

- The certificate template modification and addition process lacked a secondary confirmation step, increasing the risk of errors.
- Based on the previous case, relying solely on one lint tool does not fully meet our certificate compliance checking needs. We will incorporate pkilint and certlint, and SHECA's extended lint tool mentioned in previous reports, into a single service to avoid issues due to lint tools not being timely updated or missing certain error checks.
- Over-reliance on lint tools. In addition to using integrated lint tools to check newly issued certificates after system or template changes, manual verification steps should be added to compare issued certificate data.

#### **Where we got lucky**

- The number of issued certificates was small, minimizing the impact on subscribers.

### **Action Items**

| **Action Item**                                              | **Type**  | **Due Date** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| Check all certificate templates and adjust problematic ones  | *Prevent* | 2024-06-17   |
| Fix the issuing system to ensure that certificates will not include extension items with empty values | *Prevent* | 2024-06-24   |
| Add a secondary confirmation process for template modifications and additions, requiring different personnel for modification and confirmation | *Detect*  | 2024-06-28   |
| Rebuild the lint tool to integrate zlint, pkilint, and certlint, and include the custom lint extensions from Shanghai CA, as mentioned in the previous case. | *Detect*  | 2024-06-28   |
